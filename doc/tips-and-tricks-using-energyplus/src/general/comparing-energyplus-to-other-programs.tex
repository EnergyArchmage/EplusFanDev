\section{Comparing EnergyPlus to Other Programs}\label{comparing-energyplus-to-other-programs}

A paper comparing and contrasting Energy Simulation Programs can be found here:

http://www.eere.energy.gov/buildings/tools\_directory/pdfs/contrasting\_the\_capabilities\_of\_building\_energy\_performance\_simulation\_programs\_v1.0.pdf

As this paper was published in 2005, it is out of date (at least with current EnergyPlus capabilities).

The feature highlights from EnergyPlus releases can be seen here:

In addition you can see how EnergyPlus compares to other programs (which have submitted their models) in our testing reports:
